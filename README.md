## 🤖 Sarcasm Detection in Tweets Using BERT

In this project, we’re building a **sarcasm classifier** to detect sarcastic tweets using the **BERT** model. We’ll be fine-tuning **BERT** from **TensorFlow Hub** to handle this task, diving into how transformers can help us understand sarcastic text. Let’s get started with some sarcasm! 😏

## Project Overview

**BERT** (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is one of the most powerful NLP models for capturing linguistic nuances, and in this project, we’ll fine-tune it to classify sarcastic tweets. We’ll use the **Multi-modal Sarcasm Detection Dataset** for this, and the goal is to train a model that can effectively detect sarcasm in text.

We’ll retrieve the pretrained BERT model from **TensorFlow Hub** and fine-tune it using **Keras** and **TensorFlow**. Along the way, we’ll preprocess the dataset, create visualizations to better understand the data, and evaluate the model’s performance using **scikit-learn**.

### Key Features:

- 😏 **Sarcasm Detection**: Build a sarcasm classifier fine-tuned on the BERT model.
- 🔥 **Fine-Tune BERT**: Load the pretrained BERT model from **TensorFlow Hub** and train it on sarcastic tweets.
- 📊 **Dataset Preprocessing**: Load and preprocess the **Multi-modal Sarcasm Detection Dataset** with **pandas** and **NumPy**.
- 📈 **Visualizations**: Use **Matplotlib** and **seaborn** to create visual insights from the data.
- 🧪 **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model’s performance using **scikit-learn** to generate a classification report.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for the project.
- **Keras**: For building and fine-tuning the classification model.
- **TensorFlow**: Backend for training the deep learning model.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For creating data visualizations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For model evaluation and performance metrics.
